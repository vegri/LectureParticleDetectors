The kinetic energy of the electrons is proportional to $\frac{1}{\Delta E^2}$. $\Delta E$ is theenergy transfer of the projectile to the shell electron.\[\frac{d\sigma}{d\Delta E} = \frac{2\pi z^2 \alpha^2 \hbar^2}{\beta^2 m_e}\cdot \frac{1}{\DeltaE^2}\]The tails of this distribution stretch to $\Delta E_\text{max}$,\[\Delta E_\text{max} = \frac{2m_e c^2 \beta^2 \gamma^2}{1+ 2\gamma\frac{m_e}{M}+\left( \frac{m_e}{M} \right)^2}\]with the limits\begin{itemize}  \item $\gamma\rightarrow\infty$: $\Delta E \rightarrow \gamma Mc^2$  \item $m_e \rightarrow M$: $\Delta E \rightarrow m_e c^2 (\gamma -1) = E- m c^2$ \\  		The entire energy is transfered to the shell electron.\end{itemize}These tails can stretch very far for relativistic particles and produce electrons with energies ofseveral keV. They can be detected as so-called Delta electrons in detectors with high granularityand spatial resolution.\\Rare irradation with high energy leads to more flucuations in $\frac{dE}{dx}$ measurements used toidentify particles and therefore worsens the resolution. Even with detectos of low granularitydoes this emission of Delta electrons result in a diminishment of spatial resolution. \\A precise calculation shows:\[\Delta E (\Theta) = \frac{2m_e}{\text{tan}^2\Theta} \]Larger angles of irradiation leads to lower energies of the Delta electrons which results in ashorter range.
