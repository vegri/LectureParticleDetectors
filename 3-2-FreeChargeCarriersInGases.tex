One important quantitiy for the description of charge carriers in gases is the mobility $\mu$:

\[v_D = \mu\cdot E \cdot \frac{p_0}{p}  \]

with gas pressure $p$ and $p_0\approx 1013\,$mbar. $\mu$ is the factor of proportionality of the
electric field $E$ and the mean velocity $v_D$ of the charge carrier in this electric field, the
drift velocity.
\\
For gas mixtures, we get

\[\frac{1}{\mu_{i^+}} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{c_k}{\mu_{i^+_k}}  \]

with $c_k$ as volume concentration of gas $k$ and $\mu_{i^+_k}$ as mobility of the ion of kind $i$
in gas $k$.
