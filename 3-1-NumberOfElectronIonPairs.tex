For excitation dominates ionisation, the loss of energy that is necessary to ionise an atom islarger than the ionisation energy of the atom. The mean number of electron-ion-pairs is given by \[\frac{\text{Energieverlust des Teilchens}}{\text{mittlere Energie f√ºr die Erzeugung eines$e^-$-Ion-Paares}} \]Typical values for the required energy are about $30\,$eV. This way, a particle with $3\,$keVproduces about $\frac{3000\,\text{eV}}{30\,\text{eV}}=100$ $e^-$-ion-pairs.\begin{figure}[H]	\centering	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Fig-03-01.jpg}\end{figure}The goal is to determine the loss of energy of particles. The idea is to count the number of theproduced $e^-$-ion-pairs - the larger the number, the more precise the measurement. \[\text{particle energy}\approx \#(\text{$e^-$-ion-pairs})\cdot (\text{mean energy for one$e^-$-ion-pair})\]For a number $N_{\text{Mess}}\ge 20$, we obtain a Gauss curve for repeated measurements of theproduced primary total ionisation.\begin{figure}[H]	\centering	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{dummy.jpg}\end{figure}The relative resolution in this case is given by\[\frac{\sigma_{a}}{\langle a \rangle} =\frac{\sqrt{N_{\text{Mess}}}}{N_{\text{Mess}}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{\text{Mess}}}}\]as the best possible resolution for a highly statistical process. In fact, we obtain small valuesaround the so called Fano factor $F$:\[ F:=\frac{\text{observed resolution}}{\text{expected resolution (from Poisson statistics)}} \]Examples:\ldotsThe ionisation processes are not statistically independent!
